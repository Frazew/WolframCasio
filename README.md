# WolframCasio - Arduino and Casio part
This is the Casio applet and Arduino code for the WolframCasio project. The arduino code is pretty self-explanatory but the casio part sadly isn't yet very documented (On the todo list). Hopefully you just have to compile the applet and see what happens next !
##What is WolframCasio ?
WolframCasio is a project I started after my maths teacher told me how sad it is not to have Wolfram on that poor FX-9750GII. So when I got home, I took an Arduino, a PC, crafted a nice 3pin-to-wires cable and gathered some time ! And here it is, not finished yet and not perfect at all.
##Where can I find the other sources ?
All the sources you should need to run it are available in those repositories :
* http://github.com/Frazew/WolframCasio-PC/ <-- This is where you will find the PC code you will need
* http://github.com/Frazew/WolframCasio <-- This is where you are

##And how do I know the setup for this ?
Please see the wiki ! (TODO)
##And the licence ?
The license is GNU GPL altough some of the libraries I used may have a less restrictive license. If so, they of course keep that license !
